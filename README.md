# Excalidraw in Visual Studio

I've started this project as an experiment to see if I could get Excalidraw to work in Visual Studio. 
I've been using Excalidraw for a while now and I love it. It's a great tool for creating diagrams and 
sketches. Having Excalidraw embedded in VSCode, Obsidian, and other tools is already possible, but
having it in Visual Studio would be great.

## Planning Notes

Excalidraw is available for embedding with documentation at https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/integration.

An interesting comment made [here](https://mfyz.com/create-quick-diagrams-and-wireframes-using-excalidraw-vscode/#:~:text=libraries.excalidraw.com/-,VSCode%20Extension,-Even%20though%20I)
is that a .excalidraw.png file contains both the excalidraw file and the image!

Rick Strahl has some priceless information regarding interop between .NET and Javascript using
the WebView2 control: https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Jan/26/Chromium-WebView2-Control-and-NET-to-JavaScript-Interop-Part-2.
